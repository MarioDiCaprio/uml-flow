# React Flow Nodes
This directory contains all nodes for React Flow. These nodes are needed
for each UML diagram type. Note that each node has settings that can be
found under `/src/components/_flow/settings`. These settings change the
state of each node by using the Zustand store. Therefore, each node's
data is saved in the store.
