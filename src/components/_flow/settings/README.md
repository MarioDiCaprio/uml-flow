# Node Settings
This directory contains components for a node's settings panel. This panel
is displayed in the top right corner of the screen when a node is clicked.
Components are then rendered inside this panel. It can be found under
`/src/components/_flow/panels/NodeSettingsPanel`. Note that state
changes are made using the Zustand store.
